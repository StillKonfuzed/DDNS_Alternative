# DDNS_Alternative
DDNS Alternative - Gets external IP through powershell and updates to your custom server every 10 minutes with taskscheduler. 
No need for thirdparty apps or first login to machine to enable the task etc. 
I use it for RDP only.


``ServerCode``
 Upload server code to cpanel or point to some .net service and try to receive these parameters in body : ``ip``, ``timestamp``,``xString``
  Create a log file or save it to db then use that source to show to the hosted site.
